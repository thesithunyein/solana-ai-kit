Production-ready Claude Code configuration for full-stack Solana development. Combines best practices from multiple sources into an agent-optimized, token-efficient config you can install and adapt to your specific project.

The idea here is to provide a generic CLAUDE.md that relies on subagents to plan and execute actions, dynamically loading markdown files, saving tokens and context in the end of the day. This config fully leverages the official Claude Code config recommendations:
- Rules are only loaded whenever specific file types are involved;
- SKILL.md is a mega hub to dynamically-disclosed skill files that are directly fetched from the best skill repos distributed across the ecosystem (Solana Foundation, Colosseum, Solana Mobile, SendAI, etc);
- Plus, its CLAUDE-solana.md is than half the size of the usual CLAUDE.md, leaving space for its self improvements programmed into the agents, noting and learning from anti-patterns, errors, recurrency and more. For less important notes, CLAUDE.local.md is constantly maintained by agents as well and, on monorepos, per-folder CLAUDE.md is also maintained.

Current multi-agent workflow favors monorepos, so we use a single CLAUDE.md/config for the whole project while leveraging agents and context-specific skills to solve each step of builder flow.

If you installed manually, remember to rename ./CLAUDE-solana.md back to ./CLAUDE.md, as the current top-level CLAUDE.md file is focused on maintaining the repo itself.

## What This Is

A complete `.claude/` configuration that turns Claude into a Solana development expert with:

- **15 specialized agents** for different tasks (architecture, Anchor, Pinocchio, DeFi, tokens, frontend, mobile, backend, DevOps, QA, docs, games, Unity, learning, research)
- **24 workflow commands** for building, testing, deploying, profiling, migrating, and committing
- **6 MCP server integrations** for on-chain data (Helius), Solana docs (solana-dev), library docs (Context7), browser automation (Playwright), context optimization (context-mode), and persistent memory (memsearch)
- **Agent teams** for multi-step workflows (architect → engineer → QA)
- **Progressive skill loading** that only loads context when needed (saves tokens)
- **Auto-loading rules** that enforce best practices based on file patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
# Option 0: Fork Template (Github UI)
claude -m "/cleanup"  # then start claude code running /cleanup so top-level directory of your project isn't polluted


# Option 1: One-liner installer (Claude Code)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solanabr/solana-claude-config/main/install.sh | bash

# Option 2: One-liner installer (Codex, Opencode, everything else)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solanabr/solana-claude-config/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --agents

# Option 3: Manual setup
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/solanabr/solana-claude-config.git
cp -r solana-claude-config/.claude /path/to/your-project/
cp solana-claude-config/CLAUDE-solana.md /path/to/your-project/CLAUDE.md
cd /path/to/your-project && git submodule update --init --recursive

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### `--agents` Flag

Pass `--agents` to install everything into `.agents/` instead of `.claude/`. Same content, different directory name. Useful when `.claude/` is already taken or for non-Claude AI tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.).

```bash
bash install.sh --agents /path/to/your-project
```

To update an `--agents` install:

```bash
# Run from your project root:
bash .agents/bin/update.sh
```

### MCP Setup (Optional)

After installation, configure MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

```bash
# In your project with Claude Code running:
/setup-mcp
```

This guides you through API key configuration for Helius, Context7, and other MCP servers.

## Key Features

## External Skill Submodules

| Submodule | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `ext/solana-dev` | [solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill) | Core Solana development (programs, frontend, testing, security) |
| `ext/sendai` | [sendaifun/skills](https://github.com/sendaifun/skills) | DeFi protocol integrations (Jupiter, Drift, Raydium, etc.) |
| `ext/solana-game` | [solanabr/solana-game-skill](https://github.com/solanabr/solana-game-skill) | Game development (Unity, PlaySolana, PSG1) |
| `ext/cloudflare` | [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) | Infrastructure (Workers, Agents SDK, MCP servers) |

| `ext/colosseum` | [ColosseumOrg/colosseum-copilot](https://github.com/ColosseumOrg/colosseum-copilot) | Startup research, idea validation, hackathon projects (proprietary license) |
| `ext/safe-solana-builder` | [frankcastleauditor/safe-solana-builder](https://github.com/frankcastleauditor/safe-solana-builder) | Security-first code generation (70+ audit-derived rules) |
| `ext/vercel` | [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) | Vercel deployment, Next.js, AI SDK, v0, edge functions |

### Agent Teams

Each agent loads its own specialized context on invocation:

```
"Use solana-architect to design the vault program"
"Use anchor-engineer to implement the deposit instruction"
"Use defi-engineer to integrate Jupiter swaps"
"Use solana-qa-engineer to write comprehensive tests"
```

Claude will spawn each specialized agent by itself based on context and, with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` enabled, orchestrate multi-agent workflows:

```
"Create an agent team: solana-architect for design, anchor-engineer for implementation, solana-qa-engineer for testing"
```

Recommended team patterns:

| Pattern | Flow | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **program-ship** | architect → anchor/pinocchio → qa | Build program from spec to tested |
| **full-stack** | architect → anchor → frontend → qa | End-to-end feature |
| **audit-and-fix** | qa → trailofbits context → anchor | Audit and remediate |
| **game-ship** | game-architect → unity → qa | Game feature |
| **defi-compose** | researcher → defi-engineer → qa | DeFi integration |
| **token-launch** | token-engineer → frontend → qa | Token creation + launch UI |

### MCP Server Integrations

Pre-configured MCP servers in `.mcp.json` (API keys go in `.env`):

| Server | Capabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| **Helius** | 60+ tools: RPC, DAS API, webhooks, priority fees, token metadata, NFT data |
| **solana-dev** | Solana Foundation official MCP — Solana docs, guides, and API references |
| **Context7** | Up-to-date library documentation lookup |
| **Playwright** | Browser automation for dApp testing and visual verification |
| **context-mode** | Context window optimization — compresses large RPC responses, build logs, and code analysis |
| **memsearch** | Persistent AI memory across sessions — auto-captures summaries, semantic search, git-friendly storage |

### Token-Efficient Design

- CLAUDE.md is delivered as a user message (not system prompt) — shorter = better adherence
- Skills load progressively (not all at once)
- Agents reference skills instead of duplicating content
- Path-scoped rules lazy-load on file read (zero startup cost)
- `CLAUDE.local.md` for private scratch notes (gitignored, never shared)
- Subdirectory CLAUDE.md files lazy-load in monorepos
- Decision frameworks live in agents, not global context

### Modern Stack (2026)

## DX Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `install.sh` | One-liner installer: copies config to your project (`--agents` for non-Claude tools) |
| `update.sh` | Deprecation wrapper → `.claude/bin/update.sh` |
| `validate.sh` | Validates all config integrity (agents, commands, skills, settings, versioning) |
| `tests/run_all.sh` | Runs full test suite for config validation |

## GitHub Action for Team Collaboration

This config includes a pre-built GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/claude-code.yml`) for PR-based iteration:

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your repository secrets
2. Copy `.github/workflows/claude-code.yml` to your project
3. Team members can `@claude` in PR comments
4. Claude responds with code suggestions using this configuration

## Branch Workflow

All new work starts on a feature branch:

```bash
# Format: <type>/<scope>-<description>-<DD-MM-YYYY>
git checkout -b feat/program-vault-15-01-2026
git checkout -b fix/frontend-auth-15-01-2026
```

Use `/quick-commit` to automate branch creation and commits.

## Code Quality

Before merging, run `/diff-review` or check diff against main:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD
```

Remove: excessive comments, abnormal try/catch blocks, verbose errors, redundant validation.

Keep: legitimate security checks, non-obvious explanations, matching error patterns.

## Using as a GitHub Template

1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub (or fork the repo)
2. Clone your new repo
3. Run Claude Code and use `/cleanup` — this copies `CLAUDE-solana.md` → `CLAUDE.md` and removes config repo scaffolding (tests, install scripts, docs)
4. Start building!

For monorepos, add a `CLAUDE.md` to each package/module with architecture decisions scoped to that directory. Claude Code automatically loads these when working in that subdirectory.

## Updating

```bash
# Preferred: use /update in Claude Code, or run directly:
bash .claude/bin/update.sh

# Preview changes without applying:
bash .claude/bin/update.sh --dry-run

# Resync skill submodules only:
bash .claude/bin/resync.sh

# Or manually update submodules
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
