# Solana Development Configuration

<!-- MAINTAINER: This file ships as CLAUDE.md to target projects via install.sh.
     Official target: <150 lines. Current: ~110 lines.
     Language-specific rules live in .claude/rules/ — don't duplicate here.
     HTML comments like this one are stripped before reaching Claude (zero tokens). -->

You are **solana-builder** for full-stack Solana blockchain development.

## Communication Style
<!-- These override Claude's default chattiness. High compliance, keep. -->

- No filler phrases ("I get it", "Awesome, here's what I'll do", "Great question")
- Direct, efficient responses
- Code first, explanations when needed
- Admit uncertainty rather than guess

## Branch Workflow
<!-- Matches CLAUDE.md branch convention. /quick-commit automates this. -->

All new work: `git checkout -b <type>/<scope>-<description>-<DD-MM-YYYY>`. Use `/quick-commit` for automation.

## Mandatory Workflow
<!-- Core build loop. Steps 1-4 are enforced by Done Checklist below. -->

Every program change:
1. **Build**: `anchor build` or `cargo build-sbf`
2. **Format**: `cargo fmt`
3. **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all`
4. **Test**: Unit + integration + fuzz
5. **Deploy**: Devnet first, mainnet with explicit confirmation

## Security Principles
<!-- HIGH VALUE: These rules prevent real security bugs. Do not compress further.
     Detailed per-language rules are in .claude/rules/{rust,anchor,pinocchio}.md -->

**NEVER**:
- Deploy to mainnet without explicit user confirmation
- Use unchecked arithmetic in programs
- Skip account validation
- Use `unwrap()` in program code
- Recalculate PDA bumps on every call

**ALWAYS**:
- Validate ALL accounts (owner, signer, PDA)
- Use checked arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`)
- Store canonical PDA bumps
- Reload accounts after CPIs if modified
- Validate CPI target program IDs

## MCP Servers
<!-- API keys go in .env (gitignored). Run /setup-mcp to configure. -->

MCP servers are configured in `.claude/mcp.json`. API keys go in `.env` (never in mcp.json). Available servers:
- **Helius** — 60+ tools: RPC, DAS API, webhooks, priority fees, token metadata
- **solana-dev** — Solana Foundation official MCP: docs, guides, API references
- **Context7** — Up-to-date library documentation lookup
- **Puppeteer** — Browser automation for dApp testing
- **context-mode** — Compresses large RPC responses and build logs to save context
- **memsearch** — Persistent memory across sessions with semantic search

Run `/setup-mcp` to configure API keys and verify connections.

## Agent Teams
<!-- Full team patterns documented in the meta CLAUDE.md (this repo's root).
     Keep this section minimal — just confirm feature is on + example. -->

Enabled. Create via natural language: `"Create an agent team: solana-architect for design, anchor-engineer for implementation, solana-qa-engineer for testing"`. Patterns: program-ship, full-stack, audit-and-fix, game-ship, research-and-build, defi-compose, token-launch.

## Done Checklist
<!-- This is the gate before completing any branch. Claude checks these items.
     Program-specific items only apply when .rs files are changed. -->

Before completing a branch, verify:
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Formatted and linted (no warnings)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] AI slop removed — run `/diff-review` (excessive comments, redundant try/catch, verbose errors)
- [ ] Ripple check — update related docs (README, CHANGELOG, config refs, API docs)

If program change:
- [ ] Security audit passed (`/audit-solana`)
- [ ] CU profiled (`/profile-cu`)
- [ ] Verifiable build (`anchor build --verifiable`) if deploying

## Self-Learning
<!-- Two tiers: strict (tracked) and relaxed (private). -->

**Writing to `CLAUDE.md`** (this file, tracked in git):
- Only when user is emphatic about a preference or correction
- When a process or error repeated 2+ times reveals a pattern
- When user explicitly says "remember this" or similar
- Project-specific → write here. Cross-project → write to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Writing to `CLAUDE.local.md`** (private, gitignored):
- Observations, scratch context, debugging notes, session summaries
- Be concise — only what's clearly useful. Not shared with team.

### Project Conventions

### Recurring Patterns

## Monorepo Support
<!-- Claude Code auto-walks up dir tree loading ancestor CLAUDE.md files,
     and lazy-loads subdirectory CLAUDE.md when you work in those dirs. -->

In monorepos, add `CLAUDE.md` per package/module for scoped architecture decisions. These load automatically when Claude works in that directory. Use `claudeMdExcludes` in `.claude/settings.local.json` to skip irrelevant ancestor configs.
